Using the current design (colors and how the components look like),i wanted to have a floating conxtextual menu on the right side.

it like a button that on click it will have list of options but for now only Summary is there.

On click of summary, it will navigate into a page called prize optimization summary.

In that page i wanted to see a donot like summary of weekly/monthly profit cp and weekly/monthly profit rp same with revenue.

may some dashboards about per region or international etc. you can decide based on the mock data we have. just make sure the look is same with our theme.
